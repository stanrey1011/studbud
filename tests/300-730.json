The issue is that 127.0.0.1 (loopback address) is incorrectly used as the peer address, which prevents IKE negotiation. In a FlexVPN site-to-site GRE tunnel over IPsec, the peer address must be set to the public IP address of the remote router. In this case, Router_A's public IP address is 192.16.1.1.",
